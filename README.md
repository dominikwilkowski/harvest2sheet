<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominikwilkowski/harvest2sheet/released/assets/harvest2sheet.gif" alt="Running harvest2sheet can batch several tasks together"></p>

## Install

To install this app you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Install via:

```sh
npm install -g harvest2sheet
```

## Creating login credentials

`harvest2sheet` has the ability to help you with setting up your credentials for harvest and google. IT will lead you through the process to create them and then generate the `project.json` for you that you can get started with.

To start the wizard run:

```sh
harvest2sheet login
```

## Configure

`harvest2sheet` requires a `project.json` file to run its tasks off of.

The `project.json` format is as follows:

```json
{
	"HARVEST_ACCESS_TOKEN": "Add your personal token here",
	"HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID": 666,
	"GOOGLE_ID": "Add your google ID here",
	"GOOGLE_SECRET": "Add your google secret here",
	"GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "Add your google refresh token here",
	"tasks": {
		"project1": {
			"harvestProject": 42,
			"from": "2020-08-01T00:00:00",
			"to": "2020-08-31T23:59:59",
			"spreadsheetID": "Add your google sheets ID here",
			"tabName": "Add your google sheet tab name here"
		},
		"project2": {
			"harvestProject": 42,
			"from": "2020-08-01T00:00:00",
			"to": "2020-08-31T23:59:59",
			"spreadsheetID": "Add your google sheets ID here",
			"tabName": "Add your google sheet tab name here"
		}
	},
	"output": [
		"date",
		"user",
		"client",
		"project",
		"task",
		"hours",
		"rounded_hours",
		"notes",
		"billable_rate",
		"billable_amount",
		"cost_rate",
		"cost_amount",
		"currency"
	]
}
```

The login block on the top is important and can be generated by running `harvest2sheet login`.

### The `tasks` object

The project name, used internally only. Can be anything.

#### `harvestProject`

The harvest project ID. Find it by navigating to the project inside the harvest web app and look at the URL.

An example might be `https://yourorg.harvestapp.com/projects/1234567` in which case the `harvestProject` is `1234567`.

#### `from`

This is a time from which you like to get the harvest data.

The format is: `[year]-[month]-[day]T[hour]:[minute]:[second]`.

#### `to`

This is a time to which you like to get the harvest data.

The format is: `[year]-[month]-[day]T[hour]:[minute]:[second]`.

#### `spreadsheetID`

This is the spreadsheet ID. Find it by navigating to your spreadsheet in the web app and look at the URL.

An example might be `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZZS15TTMxQRjeX2nI-u4zJMQJu0QzhlKRgOC17jLG6X/edit#gid=0`
in which case the `spreadsheetID` is `1ZZS15TTMxQRjeX2nI-u4zJMQJu0QzhlKRgOC17jLG6X`.

#### `tabName`

The name of the tab you want to add the harvest data.

Please note that all data inside that tab will be erased.

### The `output` array

The output array let's you pick and sort what things you want to be added to the spreadsheet.

If you don't specify anything `harvest2sheet` will default to:

```json
"output": [
	"date",
	"user",
	"client",
	"project",
	"task",
	"hours",
	"rounded_hours",
	"notes",
	"billable_rate",
	"billable_amount",
	"cost_rate",
	"cost_amount",
	"currency"
]
```
